## Cryptography

This is an exercise on improving code quality as part of the Software Engineering Project Management
course of the CS PgDip at the University of Essex Online. 

## Instructions

Refer to the Mertz (2019) resource.  Use some Python code which you have developed in the past and apply at least 3 of the strategies presented at the source to improve its quality

## Response

The code was checked and improved using the Merz (2019) recommendation by doing the following:

1- Importing at the top of the file, and improting standard libraries first then third party libraries
2- Appropriate names were used the are self explaninig
3- The length of the code was limited to 72 chars for docstrings and comments, and to 99 for code
